# Project Deliverables

This project uses the [UX Wireframes](./docs/ux-wireframes/) as a basis for the functionality and user experience delivered.

Due to various factors (including time constraints and ambiguity in the wireframes), some aspects of the delivered application differ from the UX wireframes.

## Feed screen

All screens in the **Feed** menu have been implemented as specified in the UX wireframes, with data defined and stored in a graph.cool data store.

## Other screens

All other screens in the app use static data and/or images. These screens have a watermark at the bottom of the screen to indicate this, and touchable areas of the screen are indicated with a transparent blue overlay.

## Sundry

### Event screen

On the **Event** screen, the submenu in the middle of the screen (**About** / **Location** / **Events** / **Other**) has not been implemented because there is no functionality specified in the UX mockups.

### Navigation

The **Settings** menu item has been changed to **Log out**, because no functionality specified in UX mockups. There are also questions about how the UX would differ on an Android device (which already has the navigation as a drawer from the left of the screen).
